# chatz
A simple, contacts-oriented, Firestore-based chat app for iOS.

## Project background
This app served as an outlet to try out Firebase and, more specifically, Firestore. It takes a contacts-first approach, by which is meant that the contacts and chats lists are combined into one view.

## To do
Work on this app was halted once basic chat functionality and notifications were working. The feature and bug list is long, but is not included here. Perhaps most glaring are the numerous calls to the backend, which should ideally be optimized.

## Security
Passwords are handled by Google and should remain private so long as Google is able to keep them that way. However, email addresses and messages are sent in plain text.

## Attribution
The base resources for this project came from a [Udemy course] by Angela Yu, specifically the iOS 11 [Firebase project]. The guide presented there was used mainly as inspiration, and while the Xcode project was downloaded from the abovestated resource, the majority of the code and other assets are original. I believe it is within my rights of having purchased the course to publish this repository, but I will happily comply with any requests if this is found not to be the case.
